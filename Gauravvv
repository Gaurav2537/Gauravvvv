#Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We use a dictionary where the keys are city names and the values are lists of neighboring cities accessible by train.
   
2. **DFS Algorithm**:
   - We perform a depth-first search starting from Kiev.
   - We use a set `visited` to keep track of cities that have been visited.
   - The `route` list keeps track of the current path.
   - If a city is visited or not part of the target cities, the function returns `False`.
   - If all target cities are visited, it returns `True` indicating a complete route is found.
   - We recursively traverse each neighbor of the current city. If the traversal leads to a complete route, we return `True`. Otherwise, we backtrack.
