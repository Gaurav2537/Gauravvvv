#Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We use a dictionary where the keys are city names and the values are lists of neighboring cities accessible by train.
   
2. **DFS Algorithm**:
   - We perform a depth-first search starting from Kiev.
   - We use a set `visited` to keep track of cities that have been visited.
   - The `route` list keeps track of the current path.
   - If a city is visited or not part of the target cities, the function returns `False`.
   - If all target cities are visited, it returns `True` indicating a complete route is found.
- We recursively traverse e
ach neighbor of the current city. If the traversal leads to a complete route, we return `True`. Otherwise, we backtrack.


#Algorithm
function find_route(start_city):
    visited = {}
    route = []

    // Define Graph and Add Connections
    graph = Graph()
    for each ticket in tickets:
        graph.add_edge(ticket.source, ticket.destination)

    // Depth-First Search
    dfs(start_city, visited, route)

    return route

function dfs(city, visited, route):
    visited[city] = true
    route.append(city)

    if city in graph:
        for each neighbor in graph[city]:
            if neighbor not visited:
                dfs(neighbor, visited, route)
